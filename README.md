# PolyPocket

A Python script to find roots of polynomial equations.

Current state: Initial. Uses only Newton's Method for now. I haven't added any visuals yet, but that's the plan.
In the future I plan to include possible solutions via the Rational Root Theorem (p/q), Briot-Ruffini, Bhaskara, and grouping factoring

Still doesn't find complex roots! I also haven't checked if the Newton method will diverge (it definitely will sometimes).

Expected results and additional explanations are in the notes.tex file, which are my supermemo brief notes on the topic.

## Example
